# Module 3, Lesson 3 (第11节课): Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 11, "AI Code Review - From 'Working' to 'Elegant'".
**Prompt:**
```
Epic cinematic scene, movie still. A sleek robot hand firmly holds a rough, cloudy block of material. 
  A human hand wields a futuristic polishing tool that emits a soft, controlled light. Where the tool     
  touches the block, it transforms into a perfectly clear, glowing blue crystalline structure. The        
  unpolished part of the block has a dull, moody amber color. The action symbolizes the process of        
  refactoring and improving code quality. The background is a clean, dark blue. Photorealistic,           
  hyper-detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, moody blue and amber color grade, shallow depth of       
  field, 8k.   --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 2: Review - Not Satisfied with Just "Working"
**Original Concept:** Contrast a messy but functional workshop with a clean, efficient, modern factory.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration, split-screen. On the left, a cluttered, disorganized, old-fashioned workshop with tools and parts scattered everywhere, but it is producing a simple wooden toy. On the right, a clean, brightly lit, modern automated factory with sleek robotic arms, producing the same toy with precision and order. The style is clean, vector-based, and symbolic. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 4: What is "Good Code"? - Readability First
**Original Concept:** Contrast beautifully formatted code that looks like poetry with messy, unreadable code.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration, side-by-side comparison. On the left, a block of text is formatted with beautiful, clean typography and clear indentation, resembling a well-structured poem on a pleasant background. On the right, a block of text with inconsistent fonts, no indentation, and cramped spacing, making it an unreadable mess. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 5: The AI "Trap" - Fastest vs. Best
**Original Concept:** An AI brain choosing the most direct path among many possible paths to a solution.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration.On a clean light gray background, a   
  simple robot icon has just stepped onto a thin, straight, orange bridge made of disconnected, floating  
  planks. As the robot steps on the first plank, the last plank at the far end crumbles and falls into    
  the chasm below, showing the bridge is unstable and cannot reach the destination. Below this, a         
  separate, wider bridge made of solid, interconnected blue blocks forms a robust arch. This blue bridge  
  is clearly leading to a brightly lit, welcoming finish line icon on the other side. The robot is frozen 
  in a moment of panic on the crumbling orange bridge, highlighting the consequence of choosing the       
  'fastest' path. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Summary - From "User" to "Decision Maker"
**Original Concept:** A treasure chest containing icons representing the skills learned: trade-offs (scales), analysis (report), and decision-making (stamp).
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open treasure chest, glowing from within. Inside are luminous icons: a perfectly balanced scale, a document icon with charts and graphs, and a formal-looking rubber stamp with a checkmark symbol. The style is clean, vector-based, and empowering. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 14: Next Step Preview - The Module's Final Project
**Original Concept:** A toolbox containing all the skills learned in the module, ready to be used on a final, large project.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open, organized toolbox is shown. Inside, different compartments hold glowing icons for the skills learned: a function `f(x)` icon, a bug icon, and a magnifying glass over a checklist icon (for review). Next to the toolbox, a large, rolled-up blueprint is partially unfurled, showing the plans for a new, bigger project. --ar 1:1
