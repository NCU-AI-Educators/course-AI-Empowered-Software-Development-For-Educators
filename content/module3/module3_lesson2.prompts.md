# Module 3, Lesson 2 (第10节课): Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 10, "Pair Debugging with AI - Becoming the AI's 'Project Manager'".
**Prompt:**
```
Epic cinematic scene, movie still. A human hand and a sleek, friendly robot hand are working
together, gently holding and inspecting a single, cracked block. The block is made of a glowing,
semi-transparent blue material, but a moody amber light emanates from the crack, illuminating both
hands. The background is a clean, dark blue, heavily blurred. The feeling is one of focused diagnosis
and partnership. Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, moody blue and amber
color grade, shallow depth of field, 8k.  --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 2: Review - When the Block Itself is Broken
**Original Concept:** A contrast between a perfect, working building block and a broken, glitchy one.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a perfect, glowing, solid building block labeled 'Function'. On the right, an identical block is shown cracked and crumbling, with red digital glitch effects and error symbols emanating from it. The style is clean, symbolic, and vector-based. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 4: Mindset Shift - Error is a "Clue", Not "Failure"
**Original Concept:** Contrast the mindset of a frustrated person with that of a curious detective when facing an error.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style, split-screen. On the left, a stylized character is slumped under a dark storm cloud, looking downcast at a red error message on a screen. On the right, the same character is now wearing a detective hat, holding a magnifying glass, and looking with intense curiosity at the same error message, which is now glowing like a clue. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 7: New Workflow - The AI Detective
**Original Concept:** A human detective working with an AI partner to analyze clues.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A human character wearing a classic detective hat is pointing towards a clue (a glowing red bug icon on the floor). Beside them, a friendly AI robot partner is scanning the clue, with data and analysis appearing on a holographic interface projected from its eyes. The scene depicts a high-tech, collaborative investigation. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 12: Your New Role - The AI's "Project Manager"
**Original Concept:** A project manager directing a team of AI robots.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A human character stands in front of a large digital kanban board, moving task cards around. A team of small, friendly AI robots are looking up attentively, ready to receive their assignments. The scene conveys leadership, organization, and a futuristic human-AI team dynamic. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Summary - What We've Gained
**Original Concept:** A treasure chest containing icons representing the skills learned: debugging, analysis, and project management.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open treasure chest, glowing from within. Inside are luminous icons: a detective hat with a magnifying glass, a bar chart representing analysis, and a small project management kanban board. The style is clean, vector-based, and has a rewarding feel. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 14: Next Step Preview - When Code "Works" but is "Bad"
**Original Concept:** A side-by-side comparison of two pieces of code that function identically but have vastly different quality.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration, split-screen. On the left, a block of code is represented by tangled, messy, overlapping spaghetti-like lines. On the right, a block of code is represented by clean, parallel, perfectly organized lines, like a well-designed circuit board. Both blocks have a green 'OK' checkmark, but the visual difference in quality is stark. --ar 1:1
