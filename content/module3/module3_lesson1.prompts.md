# Module 3, Lesson 1 (第9节课): Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 9, "Core Concept: Functions - The 'Building Blocks' of Code".
**Prompt:**
```
Epic cinematic scene, movie still of collaboration in programming. A human hand and a sleek, friendly robot hand are working together, assembling a complex structure using glowing, semi-transparent blocks, like Lego
bricks. Each block has a small, abstract code-like symbol on it. The background is a clean, dark blue,
and the overall style is minimalist and modern, with a color palette of blue, green, and white. The
feeling is one of partnership and creation. Photorealistic, hyper-detailed, dramatic chiaroscuro
lighting, moody blue and amber color grade, shallow depth of field, 8k. --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 2: Pain Point - Bloated Main Loop
**Original Concept:** A developer frustrated by a single, massive, tangled piece of code.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A stylized, faceless character looks stressed, facing a giant, messy ball of tangled, colorful wires and lines, representing a chaotic and monolithic piece of code. The style is minimalist and flat, using a limited color palette to emphasize complexity and frustration. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 10: Function's Return Value
**Original Concept:** A function as a black box that takes input (parameters) and gives back output (return value).
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. In the center, a sleek matte black box. A glowing blue arrow labeled
"Parameters" approaches the box. A glowing orange arrow labeled "Return Value" emerges from the box,
pointing away. Clean, symbolic, minimalist, on a light gray background. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 12: Architect's Thinking - Single Responsibility Principle
**Original Concept:** A complex, multi-tool object contrasted with a simple, single-purpose tool.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a complex, open Swiss Army knife with many tools visible. On the right, a simple, elegant, single wrench. The contrast highlights the idea of "doing one thing well". The style is clean, vector-based, with a simple color palette. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Summary - What We've Gained
**Original Concept:** A treasure chest filled with icons representing the skills learned in this lesson.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open treasure chest, glowing from within. Inside, instead of gold, there are luminous icons: a function symbol `f(x)`, an interlocking building block, and a simplified brain icon. The style is clean, vector-based, with a rewarding and satisfying feel. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 14: Next Step Preview - What If the Block is Broken?
**Original Concept:** A developer and an AI partner collaborating to fix a bug.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A stylized human character and a friendly robot character are sitting side-by-side, looking at a computer screen. On the screen is a large, red, glowing bug icon. They are both pointing at the icon, engaged in discussion. The style is clean, collaborative, and forward-looking. --ar 1:1
