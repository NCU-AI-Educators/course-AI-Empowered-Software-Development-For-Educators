# Module 2, Lesson 7: Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 7, "Giving the World a 'Heartbeat' - The Game Loop".
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. In the center, a glowing, mechanical heart made of intricate gears and circuits is pulsing with light. Lines of energy radiate outwards from the heart, flowing into and illuminating a holographic landscape of a fantasy world. The style is clean, detailed, and futuristic. The background is dark to emphasize the glowing elements. --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 2: Review
**Original Concept:** A flatline EKG, representing a program that runs once and stops.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A clean, minimalist heart monitor screen is shown. A single red line goes across the screen, representing a heartbeat, but then it goes flat (a flatline). The style is flat, symbolic, and uses a limited color palette (dark screen, red line) to convey the sense of 'no life' or 'no activity'. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 3: The Problem's Essence
**Original Concept:** A straight arrow contrasted with a circular arrow, representing linear vs. loop flows.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A simple and clear visual comparison. On the left, a straight, solid arrow points from 'Start' to 'End'. On the right, a circular arrow creates a continuous loop, with icons for 'Wait', 'Process', 'Respond' placed along its path. The style is extremely clean, flat, and symbolic, using a simple two-color palette (e.g., blue and gray). --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 4: This Lesson's Goal
**Original Concept:** A wizard casting a spell to make a giant gear turn, representing the "spell" of loops.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A stylized, minimalist wizard figure holds up a glowing staff. From the staff, a beam of light hits a massive, intricate gear, causing it to start turning. The gear is part of a larger, unseen machine. The style is clean and magical, with a palette of deep purples and glowing magical effects. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 8: Indentation
**Original Concept:** A folder containing files, representing hierarchy.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A clean, isometric icon of a folder is shown. The folder is open, revealing several neatly stacked file icons inside. The visual clearly represents a parent-child or container-content relationship. The style is flat 2.0, with simple shapes, a bright color palette, and soft shadows. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 9: `while` Loop
**Original Concept:** A beating heart or a perpetual engine, representing the `while True` loop.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A stylized, mechanical heart made of clean, simple shapes and gears. It is glowing and pulsing with a soft light, with concentric circles radiating outwards to represent a continuous beat. The style is minimalist and symbolic, using a simple color palette of red, gray, and white. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Your New Role
**Original Concept:** An engineer at a console, controlling a huge engine.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A confident, stylized character (an engineer) stands before a massive, futuristic control panel with glowing buttons and screens. Through a large window in front of them, we see a huge, complex engine with glowing, moving parts, representing the game world's core loop. The style is clean and empowering, with a cinematic feel. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 14: Hands-on
**Original Concept:** A gray world becoming colorful as a loop symbol is added.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A split-panel image. On the left, a game world is depicted in grayscale, looking static and lifeless. On the right, a large, glowing, circular arrow icon (representing a loop) is being placed over the world, and everything inside the circle is bursting with vibrant color and signs of activity (e.g., moving characters, flowing water). The style is symbolic and clean. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 21: Summary
**Original Concept:** A treasure chest with icons for automation, lists, and loops.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open treasure chest, glowing from within. Inside, instead of gold coins, there are glowing icons representing skills: a gear icon (automation), a list icon, and a circular arrow icon (loop). The style is clean, vector-based, with a fun and rewarding feeling. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 22: Next Step Preview
**Original Concept:** An artist's palette mixing the three primary colors.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A sleek, minimalist artist's palette is shown. Three dabs of glowing, vibrant primary colors (red, yellow, blue) are on the palette. From these dabs, streams of light mix and flow, creating a beautiful rainbow of secondary and tertiary colors. The style is clean, with soft gradients and a slightly glossy finish, on a neutral light gray background. The overall feeling is about creation and combination. --ar 1:1
