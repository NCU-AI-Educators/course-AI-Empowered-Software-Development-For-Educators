# Module 2, Lesson 5: Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 5, "Variables & Blueprints - Drawing Your First Jianghu Map".
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A glowing, holographic blueprint of a fantasy Chinese landscape with pagodas and mountains is being drawn by a beam of light. The style is a mix of ancient scroll aesthetics and futuristic vector lines. The background is a dark, textured blue, suggesting a digital canvas. --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 6: Pain Points of "Novel-style" Code
**Original Concept:** A programmer frustrated by tangled, messy code.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A stylized, faceless character stands in front of a screen, looking overwhelmed. On the screen is a huge, tangled knot of colorful lines, representing messy code. The character is scratching their head. The style is minimalist and flat, using a limited color palette to emphasize the feeling of confusion and complexity. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 7: Evolution of Programming: Naming Data
**Original Concept:** A variable as a labeled box holding data.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A clean, semi-transparent glass box is shown. A sleek, minimalist label on the box reads 'location_name'. Inside the box, the Chinese characters for '扬州广场' are floating as glowing, 3D text. The style is clean, with soft shadows and a minimalist aesthetic on a light gray background. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Why We Ask This Way
**Original Concept:** A brain with clear, logical gears inside, representing structured thinking.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A stylized silhouette of a human head in profile. Inside the head, instead of a brain, there is a set of clean, brightly colored, interlocking gears turning smoothly. The background is a simple, neutral color. The image represents logical, structured thinking. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 15: Hidden Crisis: Scattered Variables
**Original Concept:** Separate groups of boxes representing unlinked variables.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. Two separate groups of clean, minimalist boxes are shown. The first group has two boxes labeled 'loc1_name' and 'loc1_desc'. The second group has two boxes labeled 'loc2_name' and 'loc2_desc'. The two groups are far apart, with no connecting lines, representing their logical separation and disorganization. The style is flat and vector-based on a neutral background. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 17: Architect's Solution: Dictionary
**Original Concept:** A dictionary as a labeled cabinet that groups related attributes.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A sleek, minimalist filing cabinet is shown. The entire cabinet has a main label 'guangchang'. The cabinet has several drawers, each with its own clear label: 'name', 'description', 'exits'. The style is clean, isometric 3D, with a simple color palette and soft shadows. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 18: From Model to World
**Original Concept:** Many scattered dictionary variables, representing a lack of central management.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. Multiple, separate, complex data blocks (representing dictionaries) labeled 'guangchang', 'chaguan', etc., are scattered randomly across the canvas. There are no connecting lines between them, conveying a sense of disorganization and lack of a central management system. The style is clean and vector-based. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 21: Your New Role
**Original Concept:** The human as the architect, AI as the programmer.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A human hand (the architect) is drawing a detailed, glowing blueprint for a complex mechanical heart. Another pair of robotic hands (the AI) is using the blueprint to assemble the physical heart from various components. The style is clean and symbolic, with a clear distinction between the creative/design phase and the assembly/implementation phase. Use a palette of blues and oranges. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 25: Summary
**Original Concept:** A treasure chest filled with icons for the skills gained.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. An open treasure chest, glowing from within. Inside, instead of just gold coins, there are glowing icons representing skills: a map icon for 'modeling', and a computer terminal icon for 'output'. The style is clean, vector-based, with a fun and rewarding feeling. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 26: New "Pain Point"
**Original Concept:** A robot that can only walk in a straight line, representing a lack of choice.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A simple, cute robot is walking along a straight, narrow path. The path leads to a wall. To the left and right are other interesting paths, but the robot cannot turn to access them. The style is minimalist and flat, conveying a sense of limitation and lack of choice. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 27: Next Step Preview
**Original Concept:** A crossroads with a question mark, representing a decision point.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A path leads to a crossroads, splitting into multiple directions. At the center of the crossroads is a large, glowing question mark. Each path leads to a different stylized destination (e.g., a castle, a forest, a city). The style is clean, symbolic, and vector-based, representing the concept of choice and decision-making. --ar 1:1
