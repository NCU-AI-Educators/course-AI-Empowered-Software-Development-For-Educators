# Module 2, Lesson 6: Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for Lesson 6, "Giving the World Rules - Command Parsing & Conditions".
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A giant, translucent hand is placing a glowing chess king piece onto a holographic chessboard that represents a game world. The board has glowing grid lines and abstract terrain. The image symbolizes the act of imposing rules and logic onto a system. The color palette is dark and futuristic, with bright neon accents. --ar 16:9

## Slide 2: Review
**Original Concept:** A robot that can only walk in a straight line, representing a lack of choice.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A simple, cute robot is walking along a straight, narrow path. The path leads to a wall. To the left and right are other interesting paths, but the robot cannot turn to access them. The style is minimalist and flat, conveying a sense of limitation and lack of choice. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 7: Core Concept 2: Boolean as Switch
**Original Concept:** A clear, simple on/off toggle switch.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A large, clean, minimalist toggle switch is shown. The switch is currently in the 'ON' position, which is colored a vibrant green. The 'OFF' position is a neutral gray. The labels 'True' and 'False' are clearly visible next to the positions. The style is flat, vector-based, with long shadows, representing a clear binary choice. --ar 16:9
```

## Slide 16: Final Review
**Original Concept:** A human designer checks the work of the AI implementer.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A human hand (the architect) is holding a checklist and reviewing a complex structure being built by robotic arms (the AI). The structure is made of clean, modular blocks. The human hand is giving a 'thumbs up' or placing a checkmark. The style is clean and symbolic, with a clear distinction between the design/review phase and the implementation phase. Use a palette of blues and oranges. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 17: Value Sublimation
**Original Concept:** An artist drawing a blueprint for a robot's heart, symbolizing the human providing the "soul" for the AI to implement.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A human hand (the architect) is drawing a detailed, glowing blueprint for a complex mechanical heart. Another pair of robotic hands (the AI) is using the blueprint to assemble the physical heart from various components. The style is clean and symbolic, with a clear distinction between the creative/design phase and the assembly/implementation phase. Use a palette of blues and oranges. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 18: Summary
**Original Concept:** A brain with a checklist and a branching path, representing planning and logical review.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A stylized human head in profile. Inside, there is a glowing icon of a branching path (representing `if-else` logic) and a checklist icon (representing review/planning). The style is clean, vector-based, and symbolic, using a palette of blues and greens to convey a sense of intelligence and organization. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 19: Next Step Preview
**Original Concept:** A single film frame vs. a moving film reel, representing a "time slice" vs. "time flow".
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. On the left, a single, static frame of a film strip is shown. An arrow points to the right, where a full film reel is spinning, with the film strip flowing out of it, creating a sense of continuous motion. The style is clean, symbolic, and vector-based. The static frame is grayscale, while the moving reel is in full color, representing the transition from a static moment to a living world. --ar 1:1
