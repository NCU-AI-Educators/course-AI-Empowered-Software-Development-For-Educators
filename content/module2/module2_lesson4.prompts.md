# Module 2, Lesson 4: Image Prompts

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Original Concept:** Background image for the final project of Module 2.
**Prompt:**
```
A digital illustration in a modern infographic style. A glowing, holographic ancient Chinese scroll unfurls in the center, revealing intricate glowing lines that form a fantasy world map with mountains and rivers. The background is a dark, starry cosmos, suggesting creation and infinite possibility. The color palette is deep blues, purples, and gold, with a clean, vector art feel. --ar 16:9

## Slide 2: Review - The Three Primary Colors
**Original Concept:** An artist's palette mixing red, yellow, and blue to create many colors.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A sleek, minimalist artist's palette is shown. Three dabs of glowing, vibrant primary colors (red, yellow, blue) are on the palette. From these dabs, streams of light mix and flow, creating a beautiful rainbow of secondary and tertiary colors. The style is clean, with soft gradients and a slightly glossy finish, on a neutral light gray background. The overall feeling is about creation and combination. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 3: Project Mission - From Engine to Game
**Original Concept:** A game designer drawing maps, characters, and story.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style illustration. A game designer is viewed from a top-down perspective, working at a futuristic, minimalist desk. On the desk are glowing holographic interfaces: one showing a fantasy world map, another showing character concept art, and a third showing branching narrative paths (like a flowchart). The designer is using a stylus to interact with the holograms. The style is clean, vector-based, with a palette of cool blues, teals, and bright accent colors. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 4: Technical Starting Point
**Original Concept:** Simple Lego bricks building a complex castle.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. On the left, a few simple, primary-colored building blocks are neatly stacked. An arrow flows to the right, where these same blocks are assembled into a complex and beautiful castle. The style is clean, isometric 3D, with soft shadows and a minimalist aesthetic. The background is a plain, light color. The image conveys the idea of building complexity from simple foundations. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 8: "My Jianghu" Showcase
**Original Concept:** A developer excitedly presenting their game on stage.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A person stands on a small, clean stage in front of a large screen. They are excitedly pointing to the screen, which displays a retro-pixel art style text-based adventure game interface. The audience is represented by simple, abstract silhouettes. The style is flat, minimalist, with a vibrant color palette (e.g., teal, orange, purple) and clean lines. The focus is on the presenter's energy and the pride of creation. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 9: Brainstorming - Your "Automation" Moment
**Original Concept:** A person brainstorming, with sparks of ideas.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A stylized silhouette of a person's head is shown in profile. Inside the head, glowing gears are turning. From the head, multiple light bulbs and sparks of light are emerging, each containing a small icon representing a task (e.g., a file, a chart, a checkmark). The style is clean, vector-based, with a palette of blues, yellows, and whites, conveying a sense of creativity and problem-solving. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 10: Aha! Moment - The Secret of Programming
**Original Concept:** Simple Lego bricks building a complex castle. (Intentionally repeated)
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. On the left, a few simple, primary-colored building blocks are neatly stacked. An arrow flows to the right, where these same blocks are assembled into a complex and beautiful castle. The style is clean, isometric 3D, with soft shadows and a minimalist aesthetic. The background is a plain, light color. The image conveys the idea of building complexity from simple foundations. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 11: Module 2 Summary
**Original Concept:** A growth path up a mountain with milestones.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. A clean, winding path goes up a stylized, low-poly mountain. Along the path are four glowing milestone markers. Each marker has a simple icon: the first a 'VAR' block (Variables), the second a branching path icon (Conditions), the third a circular arrow (Loops), and the fourth a trophy (Project). The summit is bathed in light. The style is clean, vector art, with a cool, encouraging color palette. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 12: New "Pain Point" - Bloated Main Loop
**Original Concept:** A person frustrated by a tangled mess of code.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic style. A stylized, faceless character stands in front of a screen, looking overwhelmed. On the screen is a huge, tangled knot of colorful lines, representing messy code. The character is scratching their head. The style is minimalist and flat, using a limited color palette to emphasize the feeling of confusion and complexity. --ar 1:1
```

## Slide 13: Next Step Preview - Module 3
**Original Concept:** Code being packaged into blocks (functions) that are easily assembled.
**Prompt:**
```
Modern infographic illustration. On the left, messy lines of code are being fed into a machine, which outputs neat, clean, stackable blocks with simple icons on them (representing functions). On the right, a hand is easily picking up and arranging these blocks to build a clean structure. The style is clean, vector-based, with a bright and organized color palette. The image conveys the concept of encapsulation and modularity. --ar 1:1
